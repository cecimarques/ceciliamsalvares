    summary: |
      The project aimed to study ZIF-8/PVDF composites at the nanoparticle level using a coarse grained model to answer, at the molecular level, questions related to the influence of nanoparticle shape and size on the polymer structuration and gas adsorption. The project also contemplated the development (and assessment) of several force fields, stemming from different potential fitting strategies (MARTINI, force matching and iterative Boltzmann inversion), as well as different mappings for studying bulk ZIF-8. This thesis was supervised by Prof. Rocio Semino (https://www.rociosemino.com/).

    summary: |
      Courses were about fundamentals of material's science and applications within a diverse spectrum. My specialization (as well as internship and Mater thesis) was directed towards computer simulations (especially classical molecular dynamics). The topic of my Master thesis in particular was on evaluating a given force field on what concerns its ability to reproduce the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (in liquid and solid phases), self-diffusion coefficients and melting point of CaO using classical molecular dynamics, and was made under the supervision of Noel Jakse.

    summary: |
      GPA: 3.36
      
      A spectrum of courses within mathematics, chemistry and physics exist throughout a 5 year Chemical Engineering degree in Brazil. Guided by my interest, my focus was always on 
      - Differential and Integral calculus
      - Physical Chemistry & Classical Thermodynamics
      - Analytical Geometry
      - Linear Algebra
      - Differential equations

      Fundamentals of chemistry and physics were also, naturally, learnt. The former encapsulated fundamentally classical mechanics, with the learning of quantum mechanics coming later. Statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, fundamentals of solid state chemistry and density functional theory came along as "extra-curricular activities", since these are not comprised in a standard Chemical Engineering degree.

      Side jobs I had as an undergraduate:
      - Teaching assistant of the mathematics department (PUC-MG) on analytical geometry and differential and integral calculus.
      - Research assistant at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (PUC-MG) on the project "Advanced Water Treatment to Public supply during emergency situations".

      No industrial-related activity was taken at the time, with my focus always being academia on its classical definition (I believe I would hate industry-type of work).

    summary: |
      The project is about investigating organic liquids under high pressures. The goal is to unveil new compounds that can be used as pressure-transmitting-media in x-ray experiments, amongst other techniques, at high pressure as well as to understand why currently known ones indeed remain hydrostatic at high pressures (i.e. what makes them special in that matter?). The project has both a computational and an experimental part. The former is carried out by me (postdoc) and Gabriele Sosso (PI), and involves classical simulations at the atomistic resolution of several different liquids, mostly using generic force fields, while the latter is carried out by Cameron Wilson (postdoc) and Mark Senn (PI). Additionally, on the experiment side, Elizabeth Arnold (PhD) and Nick Funnel (ISIS Neutron and Muon Source who serves as a consultant in the project).
